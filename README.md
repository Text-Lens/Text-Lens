# Description
We’re running for the Huion Challenge. Whenever you have long texts to read, like articles for class for example, sometimes, the format of the text is hard to read, it’s not big enough, the brightness hurts your eyes and it’s just too long. So our web app, TextLens is here to solve this issue. TextLens is a simple AI text editor that makes your readings so much easier, and it’s extremely easy to use. All you have to do is copy paste the text you want to read, paste it in this box, and choose whether you want AI to summarize the text for you or if you want AI to ask you questions about the text you’re reading. You can also modify the text size, you can put the page in dark mode and you can our highlight feature to reduce the opacity of the text. This is useful for everyone but especially for people with vision problems because of our accessible and adaptive design or people with ADHD since focusing on long texts can be difficult without the correct tools, like our platform, TextLens.
